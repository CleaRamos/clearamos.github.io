# Quest 2: Animating the Cosmos

## Exploring the Solar System
Welcome to the space! You advande in your quest from the sea into space. You now get to ride along in a space ship and explore the 8 planets of our solar system while all going in circular orbits! 

## Quest Overview
There are two parts to this quest.
1. Solar System Simulation: animate celestial bodies using transformations and interpolations.
2. Image Processing with Compute Shaders: apply basic image manipulation using WebGPU.

   
## Feature Points
I have attempted to achieve the following points:
- **1 point**: Use simple shapes (circles) and colors to present celestial bodies and orbits.
- **1 point**: At least one planet orbits around the sun. 
- **1 point**: A complete solar system animation (i.e. the sun and the eight planets).
- **1 point**: A space-like background using an image texture.
- **1 point**: An animated spaceship or any animated object composed of at least *three* simple shapes.
